# Are Recipes with Higher Fat Contents more of a Crowd Pleaser?

## Introduction

In this project, I studied two datasets of recipes from food.com, one that contained instructional and nutritional information about each recipe itself and the other containing information about individual users' interactions with various recipes and their food.com account information.

While analyzing the dataset and ways that the different attributes of the recipe were related to one another, I wanted to further examine how users respond to various health information of each recipe. Specifically, I wanted to answer the question of _whether users prefer recipes with higher fat content or lower fat content._ Answering this question would open up more insight on whether users generally choose tastier over healthier recipes, and potentially allow us to explore different ways to promote or change a recipe post in order to boost user interactions.

#### Dataset Detailed Description
The first dataset (called 'recipes') contains recipe information from food.com's Raw_recipes.csv file and includes the recipe's creator, name, date submitted, tags, nutritonal content, steps, ingredients, description. There are 83782 rows in the data, one for each recipe. For my question in particular, I looked specifically at the 'nutrition' column, which contains nutrition information in the form `[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]`; PDV stands for â€œpercentage of daily value".

The second dataset (called 'interactions') contains user interaction data from food.com's Raw_interactions.csv file and includes user account information, reviews, and ratings for various recipes. There are 731927 rows in this dataframe, one for each interaction. The column I used to answer my question was the 'ratings' column, which contains the rating given by each user for the recipe.
